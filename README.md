# MySpreadsheets
Over they years I have created loads of spreadsheets to perform tasks.
The idea for this is that I can control these templates (with sample Data) through GIT.

Checklist.xls		Create checklists for approprite code progression

Log.xls			Track work performed. add a line with time and fill in details.
			Manually maintain half day totals

Run Tracker.xlsm	Enter number of each lap and duration of each period of running and walking.
			Shows distance, total duration and speed along with a small analysis.

ToDo.xls		ToDo list. Sequence controlled by a combination of the urgency, priority and
			the time between now() and due date
