# MySpreadsheets
Over they years I have created loads of spreadsheets to perform tasks.
The idea for this is that I can control these templates (with sample Data) through GIT.

Run Tracker.xlsm    Enter number of each lap and duration of each period of running and walking.
                    Shows distance, total duration and speed along with a small analysis.
